Week 1 Log:

- Collaborated with group members to divide up presentation tasks
- Brainstormed ideas for user scenarios, who our target users are, basically Deliverable 1 requirements
- Helped build up rough draft of presentation slides and skit
- Managed the Context portion of presentation (why Trackstar is useful, why it is needed in todays industry)
- Looked at different mobile technologies both for front-end and back-end and compared pros and cons
- Reached the decision to use React-Native and Firebase for our Tech Stack as they are the most versatile and members on our team have the most experience with those languages (not me)

- Set Goals for next week to familiarize ourselves with React-Native and look into Firebase
- Perhaps have a small working demo in order to show our group next week and to have a round table
- Looking forward to developing this coming week !!!
