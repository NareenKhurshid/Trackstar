Week 10:
- heavy implementation week , lots of code to be written , lots of tasks to be met
- brainstormed, chose, and developed a task prioritizer algorithm that was used
in organizing which tasks are projected to the user first, second, etc.
- implemented Gaby's dataMappers class in order to complete my part, and to access
database (not an easy task as the dataMappers were not easy to work with)
- collaborated with Gaby in order to better understand and work with the back end
- collaborated and asked Mitch questions to gain a more insightful view of React and
the State design pattern, and how it relates to our app specifically
- connected our Home Screen which had all the task objects to our data mappers, 
which then retrieved information from our database
- presented research and my portion of the application to our respective TA, 
everyone on our team did really well and I am very lucky to have very patient and
knowledgeful team members !

next week:
- one of our screens has been crashing on my phone for the past week, we believe
that this is because of a cross platform error , found a few articles to help
overcome this error , I am confident we will be able to solve
