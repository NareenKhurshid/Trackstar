Week 4 Log:

- created a front end UI for the course-dashboard page on my git branch
- looked through SQL page and functionality that Gaby was working on 
  - i didn't understand a lot of how that works so I should look into that soon
- merged class-creation branch into master, worked with team members to review code
and ensure code is integrated and functional
- looking to finalize course-dashboard page according to design requirements
