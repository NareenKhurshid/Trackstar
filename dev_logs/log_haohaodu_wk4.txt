Week 3 Log:

- Looked into React specific design patterns and there pros and cons
 - MVC (scalability, debugging issues, work seperability advantages)
 - Flux (unidirectional data flow, solves debugging and scalability issues,
where information and commands are passed to *stores* where eaach store
is responsible for its own domain and these stores update child components)
 - Redux (also emphasizes unidirectional data flow however, utilises a 
centralized store instead of multiple)
 - Research document is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hDuJhvRj3NNH2tzgwDk80guIViBI2FdRSjIsE6kC1wI/edit?usp=sharing
