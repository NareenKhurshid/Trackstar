Week 6-8 Log:

- Sorry the respective TA that has to mark these dev_logs, 
I lost track of time so I will just be uploading a week 6 through 8 dev log
- Was unsure of whether we had to keep updating these during reading week, between
preparing for demo presentation and working on prototype, dev logs slipped my mind

Things completed recently:

Team Task Completions:

- Helped construct basis for demo summary of prototype report,
worked with team to split up roles/tasks for presentation
- Met up with Gaby to try and gain a more in depth understanding of databases section 
of application, that way when I work with databases it will be easier to understand
with some background knowledge, as opposed to being thrown code
- Met up with Mitch to merge my work successfully with everyone elses branches / work
so that navigation was smooth and seamless
- Worked with team to come up with an overall design for prototype 
- Peer reviewed teammates code, and vice versa, making comments where needed and 
changes in my own code where advised 

Development Task Completions:

- Through the development of the UI front end for the courses dashboard, 
learned fundamentals for React lifecycles and state
- Found and followed a react-native workshop to navigate between different screens,
different pages between those screens, and how to consistently re-render components
based off of page state
- Designed and implemented the courses dashboard with own design of dashboard page
made on draw.io
- Took criticism and constructive feedback from peers to re-design dashboard page

Verbal Assesment Preparation:

- Architecture Styles 
  - Main Program + Subroutine does NOT look like the style we are using
  - Object Oriented Programming is fairly familiar and aligns with our goals
