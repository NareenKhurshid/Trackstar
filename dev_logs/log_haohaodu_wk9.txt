Week 9:
- brainstormed with team for architecture styles and design patterns, 
divided tasks for deliverable 3 presentation, interview, as well as document
- responsible for researching layered architecture style, the implementation
we decided to use, as well as understanding everyone elses choices in terms of
architecture styles, design patterns, their relations to layered architecture 
how they work and how it all fits into our codebase
- ensured that the organization of our codebase followed up with our choice
of design patterns, and UML diagrams to ensure that if we are asked 
(which we were) during the d3 interview to show our contributions to the project
and how they directly correlated to our diagrams, that everything would match
- specifically made sure that my own components, and grade calculator section matched
- had to gain an in depth understanding of our design patterns so that i could use 
them for implementation during the next week to come
