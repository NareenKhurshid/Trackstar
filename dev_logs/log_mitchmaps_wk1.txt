Week 1 Log:

- Worked with the team to iron out our plan for the D1 presentation
- Worked on the introductory skit, conclusion and created final version of presentation slides for D1
- Presented Trackstar to the class with the team
- Met up with the team post-presentation to dive into technical decisions for the project
- Helped in the decision of using React Native and Firebase to develop Trackstar
- Began experimenting with the tech stack we'll be using by making a test project and trying to get the front and backend talking to each other
  before diving into development for the real app
- Had success spinning up a React Native hello world app to test how the technology works and was delighted to see just how similar
  it is to React (I work with React every day at my current job)
- Began figuring out how to use firebase for the app
